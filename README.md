# Webex Connect iOS SDK

Webex Connect iOS SDK provides a messaging framework that enables app developers to embed bidirectional in-app messaging and interactive push notifications capabilities within their mobile applications.

## v3.x.x Modularized SDKs

We have introduced new modularized SDKs in version 3.0.0, each designed to offer specific functionality. Please follow the below table to get more details of each module and its functionality. This will help you to understand what's available in each module and decide which modules you want to integrate into your applications.

| **Module** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| WebexConnectCore<br>(Mandatory) | The Core module is the foundation of the Webex Connect SDK. It provides essential functionality that all other modules depend on, including initialization, configuration, registration, and shared utilities. |
| WebexConnectPush | The push module enables your application to receive and handle push notifications. It abstracts the underlying push notification service, providing customized support for notification management. |
| WebexConnectInAppMessaging | The inappmessaging module offers both one-way and two-way messaging capabilities for your app. |

## v2.x.x Legacy Core SDK Flavours

We continue to support the old SDKs alongside the new modularized versions.
